# CSE-30-Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe AI Project 
University of California - Merced, Data structures and Algorithms final project
## Overview

This project involves designing and implementing an unbeatable AI for Tic-Tac-Toe using C++. It showcases a variety of skills in software development, algorithms, data structures, and game design.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

### **1. Algorithms and Data Structures**

- **Graph Search and State Expansion:** Explored possible game states using graph-based representations.
- **Hash Tables:** Used for state caching to avoid recalculating already-seen game states.
- **Custom Data Structures:** Implemented data structures such as linked lists, arrays, and graphs to manage game logic efficiently.

### **2. Game Development**

- **Game Logic Design:** Designed the core game mechanics, including turn-based gameplay, win conditions, and game resets.
- **Menu System Implementation:** Built a dynamic menu system with selectable options, difficulty levels, and game-over screens.

### **3. Software Engineering Best Practices**

- **Object-Oriented Design:** Applied principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance.
- **Memory Management:** Managed dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using smart pointers and destructors.
- **Modularity:** Organized the code into multiple header and source files for better readability and maintenance.

### **4. Graphics and User Interface (UI)**

- **OpenGL Rendering:** Rendered game elements using OpenGL, including the board, markers, and interactive menus.
- **Interactive User Controls:** Implemented mouse-click handling for seamless gameplay and menu navigation.

### **5. Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking**

- **AI Strategy Design:** Developed AI decision-making strategies using depth-limited search and game state evaluation.
- **Debugging and Testing:** Conducted extensive testing and debugging to ensure flawless gameplay and optimal AI performance.

## Conclusion

This project highlights proficiency in advanced algorithms, data structures, game development, software design patterns, and graphics programming. It reflects a strong foundation in computer science principles essential for technical roles in software development and game design.
